"""Multi-agent trip planner as a LangGraph state machine with human-in-the-loop steps.

  extract -> (missing details? -> ask_missing -> extract ...) -> options -> choose [HUMAN]
          -> research -> plan -> critic -> (errors -> plan, max N) -> cost -> approve [HUMAN]
          -> (edit -> plan | cancel -> END | approve -> finalize -> END)

Agents / roles
  Intake   (LLM)            turns free text into a structured request, asks for what is missing
  Advisor  (code + season)  proposes circuits for the month
  Research (retrieval)      pulls candidate places only from the knowledge base
  Planner  (LLM)            drafts the day-by-day plan, using ONLY candidate ids
  Critic   (deterministic)  rejects plans with unknown ids, missing stays, overloaded days
  Cost     (deterministic)  prices the plan with the cost engine

Human decisions use `interrupt()`; the run pauses (state kept by the checkpointer) and resumes
with `Command(resume=...)`, so a plan can wait for an answer for hours.
